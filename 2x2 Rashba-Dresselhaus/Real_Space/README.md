# 2x2 Rasbha-Dresselhaus Quantum Solver in Real space

* This repository contains 2 libraries to solve a system (in the example, a coupled quantum well) with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions for the conduction band solved in real space.

* With it you can, for example, find the Envelope Functions for n-state with spin Up and Down.
